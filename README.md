# MIPS architecture in Proteus


In this project, a complete MIPS architecture is implemented in Proteus Design Suite. A screenshot is provided below from the schematic in Proteus. Also, there is a thorough schematic of the whole MIPS datapath in the `schematic.PDF` file. Moreover, there are some binary files to be written in memory; for example, the `alu.bin` file should be burned on the EPROM of the ALU control unit in order to provide the signals for ALU operations.
